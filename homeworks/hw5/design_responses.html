                        <p> I learned that there are many ways do design a very engaging UI. The design doesn't need to
                            be complicated to be effective. As long as the interaciton is seemless, the UI seems to flow
                            really well. </p>

                        <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                        <p> My favorite part of the article was exploring all the difference UIs. My favorite UI had to
                            be the Dark one. I found the imaging and effects extremely smooth and compelling. Also
                            anything that slided also seemed to catch my attention.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how
                            the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                        <p> My favorite inspiration was the Dark UI. This UI looks extremely simplistic, but the effects
                            really add a nice flare to it. I like the sliding animation because it makes the user
                            interaction seem seemless. Additionally, the fonts and the dark atmosphere really contribute
                            to the overall darker sense they were going for in the UI. My favorite part of it, however,
                            is how the person stays in a single spot, while his surroundings shift. This adds an air of
                            mystery. </p>

                            why.</p>
                        <p> I would give the article a 9 because there was no reading. Instead, it allowed me to explore
                            which UIs I liked the most and gain inspiration from.i </p>
