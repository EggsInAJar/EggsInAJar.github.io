							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think this article was very interesting. I found the example of spatial vs. feature-based attention especially interesting because it showed exactly how we percieved the world. This article made me more aware of how I percieve the world. It also made me more aware of my own pitfalls and how I can become a more aware person. </p>
