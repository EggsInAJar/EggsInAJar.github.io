					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> White space can be used as a tool to help maintain focus with users. This form of padding
							can also be used on a particular element to draw greater emphasis to that element. However
							too much spacing can also be a bad thing. It can make the separate elements feel
							disconnected from each other </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article were the graphics showing good and bad design choices. This
							really put into perspective the importance of whitespace and how it can direct a users
							attention. The pages with more white space felt cleaner and easier to read, and the graphics
							made that abundantly clear. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs
							need white space to breathe. Yes, this may sound corny. But I stand by this." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> I would give the article an 8 because it made me rethink what less is more really means. The
							article brings a nice perspective to design that I never really thought about.</p>
