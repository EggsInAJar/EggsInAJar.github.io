				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Though color is important, it also isn't everything. A good webpage also needs words to make
							things more accessible. It is also important to save the colors you use, so your team has
							access to it as well. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was the part where it discussed color contrast and the
							general ratio that is used. It also gave good sources to use to find good color
							combinations. I also liked the part where it discussed how many visually impaired people
							there were in the world. This made me realize just how important color accessiblity really
							is.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "To meet W3Câ€™s minimum AA rating, your background-to-text contrast ratio should be at least
							4.5:1." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> I would rate the article 7 because I enjoyed the different resources they provided. I also
							like the statistics they provided about the amount of colored impaired people in the world.
