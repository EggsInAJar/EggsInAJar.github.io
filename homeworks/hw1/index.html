        Hi! My name is Merrick. I am currently a freshman at Berekely who loves to play tennis and chess.
        I've recently been getting more into weightlifting as a past time. My favorite TV show ever is Breaking Bad and
        you can't change my mind otherwise. Besides TV shows I'm also really into anime and playing Valorant. I'm really
        excited to get started with web design, and I can't wait to learn
        more. :)

    <h3>What I learned</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I learned that every design choice within an app has a specific purpose. Whether that be bolder text to draw
            a users attention or purposely changing the search term to get users more excited, companies are strategic
            in the ways they design their UI.
        </li>
        <li>
            My favorite part of the article was reading through the specific examples of apps and analyzing them. This
            really changed the way I looked at apps and how each design decision has its reason.
        </li>
        <li>
            "The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a
            specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting."
        </li>
        <li>
            I would score the article an 8 because it opened my eyes to the different ways companies try to draw your
            attentions.
