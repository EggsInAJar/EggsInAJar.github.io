						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the Gestalt principle has four main principles to describe how people percieve visual elements when certain conditions apply. These four principles are emergence, reification, multi-stability, invariance, and proximity. Our brains often make out simple, welldefined objects before we recognize all the details.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was describing how we could apply Gestalt principles into UI design. For example we can use the proximity principle to group similar looking elements together. This will help with our visual communcation. This part was extremely interesting because it's cool to see how we can apply how are brain works to certain design principles. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "People tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form. Our brain recognises a simple, well-defined object quicker than a detailed one."</p>
						</li>
